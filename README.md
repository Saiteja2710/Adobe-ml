# Project Title: Regularization, Symmetry Detection, and Curve Completion

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the regularization of curves, symmetry detection, and curve completion. It includes multiple Python scripts that perform various tasks, some of which are designed to run on the Streamlit platform, while others work on different platforms. Each script should be executed individually to achieve the desired outcomes.

### 1. requirements_streamlit.py
- *Platform*: Streamlit
- *Description*: This script sets up the environment and dependencies required to run the Streamlit-based applications in the project.
- *Usage*: 
  bash
  streamlit run requirements_streamlit.py
  
- *Purpose*: Installs necessary packages and initializes the environment for Streamlit-based applications.

### 2. symetry_streamlit.py
- *Platform*: Streamlit
- *Description*: This script is responsible for detecting symmetry in curves using a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- *Usage*: 
  bash
  streamlit run symetry_streamlit.py
  
- *Purpose*: Provides an interactive interface to upload curve data, visualize it, and analyze symmetry properties.

### 3. other_script1.py
- *Platform*: Other Platform
- *Description*: This script handles a specific aspect of the project (e.g., regularization or curve completion). It is designed to be run independently of the Streamlit applications.
- *Usage*: 
  bash
  python other_script1.py
  
- *Purpose*: Focuses on a particular computational task related to curve analysis outside the Streamlit environment.

### 4. other_script2.py
- *Platform*: Other Platform
- *Description*: Similar to other_script1.py, this script is dedicated to another distinct task within the project.
- *Usage*: 
  bash
  python other_script2.py
  
- *Purpose*: Complements the functionalities provided by the other scripts, contributing to the overall curve analysis process.

## Installation

1. *Clone the Repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   
2. *Navigate to the Project Directory:*
   bash
   cd your-repo-name
   
3. *Install the Required Packages:*
   - For Streamlit-based scripts:
     bash
     pip install -r requirements_streamlit.py
     
   - For other scripts:
     Install any additional packages as specified within the individual scripts.

## Running the Scripts

- *For Streamlit Scripts:*
  Use the Streamlit command followed by the script name (as shown in the usage section of each Streamlit script).
  
- *For Other Scripts:*
  Run the Python script directly using the python command.
